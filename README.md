# eHf - Efficient Huffman Features

eHf is a library that converts input data from any format into a feature vector set, usually for the purposes of classification. It is based on the Huffman coding algorithm and is built using a min-heap queue for fast computation. The advantage of using eHf is that no internal knowledge is required to convert the data, so features can easily be extracted from even complex binary files.


## Features

- Fast runtime computation
- Represents data in a compressed format, using a modified Huffman coding algorithm
- Vectors are generated as arrays, so are "out of the box" ready to pass to classification algorithms

## Example usage
```sh
